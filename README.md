Encapsulated Machine Learning Framework (EMLF)

EMLF is an early prototype framework for providing governable machine learning through encapsulation of data, references, partitions, predictions, and evaluation results into a "model" pseudo object. (Nb. It is called a pseudo-object because, unlike an OOP class, it does not encapsulate its methods.) Training is achieved using algorithms applied by the user on members of the model object.

This repo is collects the mlfns.R library (which includes the EML framework's method functions), other code libraries that the framework calls on, and a demo program.
